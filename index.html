The evolution of baked goods continued over many centuries through the introduction of new ingredients and the invention of new techniques of baking. The Egyptian’s discovery and skill at using natural yeast helped those flat breads to leaven.</h3></p></div>

<center><h1>TYPES</h1></center>
<p>Cake is a flour confection made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, and is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and which share features with desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</p>
<ul>
    <li><h3 id="a">BUTTER CAKE:</h3>Butter cakes are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They rely on the combination of butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter.[11] A classic pound cake is made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Another type of butter cake that takes its names from the proportion of ingredients used is 1-2-3-4 cake: 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs.[12] According to Beth Tartan, this cake was one of the most common among the American pioneers who settled North Carolina.</li>
    <li><h3 id="b">SPONGE CAKE:</h3>are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour. Traditional sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs. They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix (generally of beaten eggs) to provide leavening, sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other chemical leaven added. Egg-leavened sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without yeast.</li>
    <li><h3 id="c">FLOURLESS CAKE:</h3>Baked flourless cakes include baked cheesecakes and flourless chocolate cakes. Cheesecakes, despite their name, are not cakes at all. Cheesecakes are custard pies, with a filling made mostly of some form of cheese (often cream cheese, mascarpone, ricotta, or the like), and have very little flour added, although a flour-based or graham cracker crust may be used. Cheesecakes are also very old, with evidence of honey-sweetened cakes dating back to ancient Greece.</li>
    <li><h3 id="d">COFFEE CAKE:</h3>is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or a coffee break. Some types use yeast as a leavening agent while others use baking soda or baking powder. These cakes often have a crumb topping called streusel or a light glaze drizzle.</li>
    <li><h3 id="e">ONE EGG CAKE:</h3>One egg cakes are made with one egg. They can be made with butter[17] or vegetable shortening.[18] One egg cake was an economical recipe when using two eggs for each cake was too costly.</li>

    <div id="a3"><h2>2.RED VELVET CAKE</h2><p>Red velvet cake is traditionally a red, red-brown, crimson, or scarlet-colored chocolate layer cake, layered with ermine icing. Traditional recipes do not use food coloring, with the red color due to non-Dutched, anthocyanin-rich cocoa. Common ingredients include buttermilk, butter, cocoa, vinegar, and flour.Velvet cake is thought to have originated in Maryland in the early 20th century. In the 19th century, "velvet" cake, a soft and velvety crumb cake, came to be served as a fancy dessert.</p></div>

    <div id="a4"><h2>3.WHITE FOREST</h2><p>So I have made a version of the white forest  cake twice. Once I used my white chocolate sponge and once I used my hot milk sponge. While the white chocolate sponge gives a much richer mouthfeel (and is probably more true to the concept of the “white” forest) , I though the hot milk soaks better and is a lighter cake. So while both are lip-smacking delicious, you can opt for your choice.I went with sweet dark cherries. You can pick fresh cherries or  go with canned ones. With the canned cherries, you can use the remaining.</p></div>

It is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both small and large commercial producers. It is classified as both a grain legume[4] and, due to its high oil content, an oil crop.[5] World annual production of shelled peanuts was 44 million tonnes in 2016, led by China with 38% of the world total. Atypically among legume crop plants, peanut.</p></div>
